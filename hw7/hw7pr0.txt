The imSitu.org system worked good for images from the examples provided. It recognizes the major objects in each image and provides similar images with the same objects. However, when I tried the system with an image of the traffic in the intersection, the similar images provided have the same context: traffic and cars but totally irrelevant situations between these images. This also affirms the claim made in the article that an underlying model (physics or context) beyond training examples is required for visual understanding such as the model of respond to the visual understanding.
