# Project Progress - initial week
#

Along with the project-proposal and plan, I ask you to spend some time this week with the initial tasks of exploring your project. 

Here is a starting point for a one-page (or so) description of your progress in this first week. It does _not_ have to be a text file like this one! Any usual document format is ok.

For example, it's ideal to elaborate on
  + [desirable]  Did you find one or more libraries/resources… what are they?
  + [desirable]  Have you successfully installed/run the software… ? How did it go?
  + [desirable]   What is your plan for getting to know the library/resources?
    + Is there a tutorial? A set of examples? Other online (or offline) guides?
    + What are they? How far have you made it in this first week?
  + [wonderful, but not required]  Have you been able to adapt one or more of the library's resources to something related to your own piece of the project


And, it's open-ended from there…

In essence, the goal here is to 
  (a) make sure the software and other resources are working by the end of the first week and 
  (b) you've successfully started using it -- and have a concrete plan for what to pursue next.

Good luck getting started on these final projects!
