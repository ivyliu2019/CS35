# Project Plan
#

Feel free to use this file -- or create another one (.docx, .pdf, ...) for your project plan.

Here is the list of things to include, copied from the hw8 page:

Overview of your idea and big-picture goals for the project
  + a description (~1 paragraph) of - overall - what you'd like the project to do/investigate - including a bit of the motivation behind it
  + Especially encouraged:  overlaps with other projects/interests you have in your major, other academic work, or something entirely non-academic

Specific Python library/libraries 
  + one (or more) Python libraries/resources you'd like to investigate/use
  + Since it's cs35, yours should be largely a Python-based project
  + it can certainly overlap with other languages
  + it can also be to learn a new Python library or framework
  + it's ideal to have an online tutorial to get you started -- as long as you go beyond that tutorial

Other resources from which you will get started: 
  + as noted, a great template is to work through a library's online or other tutorial/examples
then, do something of your own that extends those examples
  + Be sure to explain the novel vs. the provided portions of your project

Proposed timeline for progress/subgoals
  + Propose a short timeline that's  concrete as possible -- at least for the first few tasksâ€¦
    + What you'll work on this week
    + What you'll seek to have accomplished by your presentation
    + What you'll want to have completed by the end of the project
  + As we progress, you'll be able to adapt -- to align with what's interesting and feasible!
  + Still, it's still good to have a starting list of tasks.
