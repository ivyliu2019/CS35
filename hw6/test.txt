A paraphrase is your own rendition of essential information and ideas expressed by someone else, presented in a new form. It is also one legitimate way (when accompanied by accurate documentation) to borrow from a source and a more detailed restatement than a summary, which focuses concisely on a single main idea. Paraphrasing is a valuable skill because it is better than quoting information from an undistinguished passage. Also, it helps you control the temptation to quote too much and the mental process required for successful paraphrasing helps you to grasp the full meaning of the original.
