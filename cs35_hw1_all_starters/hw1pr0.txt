After reading the description of Javascript, html, CSS2 and XML, I found most languages used for web development are technically not programming languages.  While HTML is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web, CCS2 is  a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language and JavaScript is an interpreted programming language. These three languages form the core technologies of World Wide Web content production. While python is a multi-paradigm which could be used to write programs that are object-oriented or functional in all of these languages. I think the emphasis in the curriculum really depends on individual’s career path. For someone who’s interested in front-end and web development, he or she should emphasizes on HTML, CSS2 and Javascript, while for the rest that are interested in full-stack and back-end, python is much more useful.
